\section{Deterministic SIR model}

First, we begin our exploration using the simplest epidemic model.
The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model describes...:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= b(s) - \beta (t) S \frac{I}{N}\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta (t) S \frac{I}{N} - \gamma I\\
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:sir}
\end{equation}

We want to consider discretized version of this model.

TSIR and hazard-based model.
TSIR:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
S_{t + \Delta t} &= B_t + S_t - \beta_t S_t \frac{I_t}{N_t} \Delta t\\
I_{t + \Delta t} &= \beta_t S_t \frac{I_t}{N_t} \Delta t
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Assumptions are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fixed generation time
	\item Linear probability of infection
\end{itemize}
Hazard-based model:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
S_{t + \Delta t} &= B_t + S_t - S_t \left(1- \exp\left(-\beta_t \frac{I_t}{N_t} \Delta t\right)\right)\\
I_{t + \Delta t} &= S_t \left( 1- \exp\left(-\beta_t \frac{I_t}{N_t} \Delta t\right)\right) + I_t - I_t (1 - \exp(-\gamma \Delta t))
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Tries to account for variation in ... but still ... When are these assumptions appropriate?

\subsection{Probability of infection}

In both the TSIR model and the hazard-based model, transition from the susceptible comparment, $S$, to the infected compartment, $I$, is represented as a product of number of susceptible individuals and probability of infection between two time steps $t$ and $t + \Delta t$.
The TSIR model assumes that the probability of infection is a linear function of prevalence $I_t$.
This formulation is based on the Euler approximation to the solution of the ordinary differential equation.
On the other hand, the hazard-based model assumes that the probability of infection is an inverse exponential function of prevalence $I_t$.
Besides their differences in the relationship between prevalence and probability of infection, there are two more assumptions that we need to consider: (1) force of infection remains constant over two time steps and (2) new susceptible individuals have zero probability of infection between the two time steps.



\subsection{Infectious period}

Geometric distribution with probability of $1-\exp(-\gamma \Delta t)$ and unit of $\Delta t$.
Then, mean infectious period and generation interval is given by 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta t}{1-\exp(-\gamma \Delta t)}.
\end{equation}
An important but often overlooked component is the variance of the distribution.
Squared coefficient of variation for this distribution is equal to $\exp(-\gamma \Delta t)$, which necessarily depends on pre-specified time-step $\Delta t$.
If we want to match the mean of the distribution to a fixed value $\mu$ regardless of our choices of $\Delta t$, we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\hat \gamma = - \frac{1}{\Delta t} \log\left(1 - \frac{\Delta t}{\mu}\right)
\end{equation}
Then,
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{CV}_{\tiny\textrm{Infectious period}}(\Delta t)^2 = 1 - \frac{\Delta t}{\mu}.
\end{equation}

We expect changes in variation in infectious period to affect variation in stochstic realizations.

This means that the relationship between $r$ and $\mathcal R$ changes.
For this generation-interval distribution, we have
\begin{equation}
\mathcal R = 1 + \frac{\exp(r) -1}{(1-\exp(-\gamma \Delta t)) }
\end{equation}
Substituting 
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \log \left(1 + \beta \Delta t - \frac{\Delta t}{\mu}\right),
\end{equation}
as well as $\hat \gamma$, we get
\begin{equation}
\mathcal R = 1 + \frac{\mu}{\Delta t} \left(1 + \beta \Delta t - \frac{\Delta t}{\mu}\right)^{1/\Delta t}
\end{equation}
Then, we can obtain a relationship between $\mathcal R$ of a discrete-time system and that of a corresponding continuous time system, assuming that contact rate $\beta$ and mean generation-time $\mu$ are the same:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal R_{\tiny \textrm{discrete}} = 1 + \frac{\mu}{\Delta t} \left(1 + \frac{(\mathcal R_{\tiny \textrm{continuous}}  - 1) \Delta t }{\mu}\right)^{1/\Delta t}
\end{equation}

On the other hand, we may want to match choose $\beta$ and $\mu$ to match true $r$ and $\mathcal R$.



% We find that the formula for reproduction number suggested by \cite{he2009plug} only holds when generation interval is held constant.

First, we compare how the dynamics of a system depend on the value of $\Delta t$?

\subsection{Derivation of growth rate in discrete-time SIR model}


/Derivation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
S_{t+\Delta t} &= S_t - S_t (1- \exp(-\beta I_t \Delta t/N))\\
I_{t+\Delta t} &= S_t (1- \exp(-\beta I_t \Delta t/N)) + I_t - I_t (1- \exp(-\gamma \Delta t))
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Assuming tat $S_t$ is approximately equal to $N$, we get
\begin{equation}
I_{t+\Delta t} = N_t (1- \exp(-\beta I_t \Delta t/N)) + I_t \exp(-\gamma \Delta t)
\end{equation}
When $I_t \approx 0$, $\exp(-\beta I_t \Delta t/N) \approx 1 - \beta I_t \Delta t/N$ and so
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
I_{t+\Delta t} &\approx  I_t \beta \Delta t + I_t \exp(-\gamma \Delta t)\\
&= I_t (\beta \Delta t + \exp(-\gamma \Delta t))
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Substituting $\hat{\gamma}$, we get
\begin{equation}
I_{t+\Delta t} = I_t \left(1 + \beta \Delta t - \frac{\Delta t}{\mu}\right),
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
I_{t} = I_0 \left(1 + \beta\Delta t - \frac{\Delta t}{\mu}\right)^{t/\Delta t}
\end{equation}
and the initial growth rate is given by
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \log \left(1 + \beta \Delta t - \frac{\Delta t}{\mu}\right).
\end{equation}
